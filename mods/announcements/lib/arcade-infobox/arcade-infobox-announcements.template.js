The Saito Network was upgraded at 12:00pm. We're testing an upgrade to the redistribution function, so you should get the tokens back in your account reasonably quickly, although perhaps not immediately.

Other updates include a fix to Twilight Struggle, and the addition of a link to the App Store, so that players can install / compile new games into their wallet without the need to leave the Arcade. As always, feelback is very welcome.
