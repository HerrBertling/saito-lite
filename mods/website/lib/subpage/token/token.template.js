    <p>
      Following our successful IDO launched on PolkaStarter, SAITO is now available as a swappable ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum platform. Each ERC-20 SAITO represents a Native SAITO coin and is 1-to-1 convertible to native coins withheld on the native network by the Saito Team.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are very excited to have passed this milestone and look forward to continuing to leverage our amazing community to bring Saito to the next level!
    </p>
    <p>
      Details of the token can be seen on Etherscan <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF">here</a>, Coinmarketcap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/saito/">here</a>, and Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/saito">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to receive and hold your ERC-20 SAITO, you should use an ERC-20 compatible wallet such as MyEtherWallet or MetaMask.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strongly encourage you to also consider a hardware-based solution for you key storage such as a Trezor or Ledger device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure not to use the SAITO smart contract token address as a receiving address!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also be sure to keep a backup of your keys in a safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Saito Team will not be able to help you recover your funds if you keys are lost or otherwise irrecoverable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERC-20 SAITO is swappable to Native SAITO tokens.

// The Saito project is excited to announce it will partner with Polkastarter to conduct its Initial Dex Offering.
// This is a significant step for the project — one that we could not have achieved without ongoing support from our backers and partners.
// We are happy to be able to expand our supporter base and get $SAITO into the hands of our growing community. This is a key step towards building a healthy economy and vibrant community on Saito.
// About Saito
// Saito is an open network layer that delivers web3 to users. Applications on Saito can run without closed plugins, private APIs and non-open infrastructure. Saito runs without an owner while funding the nodes that provide routing and user infrastructure for its own network and other public blockchains. Saito consensus is secure, sybil resistant, and resistant to centralizing forces and monopolization — keeping web3 open and independent.
