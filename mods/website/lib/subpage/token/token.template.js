    <p>
      Following our successful IDO launched on PolkaStarter, SAITO is now available as a swappable ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum platform. Each ERC-20 SAITO represents a Native SAITO coin and is 1-to-1 convertible to native coins withheld on the native network by the Saito Team.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are very excited to have passed this milestone and look forward to continuing to leverage our amazing community to bring Saito to the next level!
    </p>
    <p>
      Details of the token can be seen on Etherscan <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF">here</a>, Coinmarketcap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/saito/">here</a>, and Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/saito">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to receive and hold your ERC-20 SAITO, you should use an ERC-20 compatible wallet such as MyEtherWallet or MetaMask.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strongly encourage you to also consider a hardware-based solution for you key storage such as a Trezor or Ledger device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure not to use the SAITO smart contract token address as a receiving address!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also be sure to keep a backup of your keys in a safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Saito Team will not be able to help you recover your funds if you keys are lost or otherwise irrecoverable.
